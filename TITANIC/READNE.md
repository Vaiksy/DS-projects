# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning.
The focus is on feature engineering, model comparison, and ensemble learning.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare,
the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and missing value handling
3. Feature engineering (Cabin, Ticket, Titles, Fare normalization)
4. Categorical encoding
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Ensemble learning (Voting Classifier)

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost
- Soft Voting Ensemble

## 🏆 Best Result
The best performance was achieved using a **soft voting ensemble including XGBoost**.
